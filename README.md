# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem related to the main project was to create a program that gave users options to read in a input file of courses, print Course from a Binary Search Tree and print all courses from a Binary Search Tree. The idea was to implement the most efficient data structure suited to the requirements of the application.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by considering the data set, my potential end users and the actions I needed to provide those users. It was important to understand different structures because use cases can change based on requirements - a Hash Table might be a great option if you need the ability to access elements by index often for example. I choose a Binary Search Tree because it has both a low sort and search complexity, also because the data set didn't have the potential to be massive, which can be a concern in relation to Binary Search Tree skewing.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I think my biggest road block was just transitioning between three different languages throughout my work week. I'm writing in Ruby and Python at my job, C++ in this class and Java in another. Context switching between the three takes me a good 30 minutes to an hour to switch my brain - on the positive side I'm getting a ton of coding exposure! I have a lot of code saved between the three languages that I can reference when I get stuck with something as well, which helps me lay out certain common things easily.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I definitely think more deeply now anytime I'm iterating/handling large data sets, and the first thought in my mind is "am I doing this in a cost effective, appropriate way?" 

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Well, I think first of all I would probably make my program more modulor if I was going to share it with the world as "usable".  I would have built a proper C++ project structure, created more classes and helper methods and I would have proper unit and integration testing. My code as written could have both the Course class and the BST class reused in other projects so I felt good about the adaptablity there.
